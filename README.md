# Product Case Studies

A curated set of product teardowns and case studies. Each folder is a self-contained case with a README that reads like a product brief (Problem → Insights → Solution → KPIs → Roadmap → Artifacts).

## Structure
```
/uber-eats-taste-profile-engine
  README.md
  /assets
  /research
  /mocks
  /data
```

## How to use
1. Duplicate the `uber-eats-taste-profile-engine` folder for each new teardown.
2. Replace the content with your own research, mockups, and KPIs.
3. Keep everything in markdown and images (portable for recruiters).

## Suggested Cases
- Uber Eats – Taste Profile Engine (personalization)
- Spotify – Social Listening (retention/virality)
- LinkedIn – Job Match Relevance (search/ranking)
- Amazon – Prime Bundles (pricing/promotion)
